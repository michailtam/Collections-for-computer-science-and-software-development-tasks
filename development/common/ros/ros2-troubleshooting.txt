NOTE: This is a collection of troubleshootings, that provides possible solutions for issues I am facing, while working on ROS2 projects, in Gazebo and RViz. 
It's not sure if the respective solution will work for your problem. Please, keep this in mind. This guide will be extended over time. Most of the solutions
were found via stackoverflow, ROS Answers, Gazebo Answers, communites for robotics and many others.


(1) Spawning the robot in Gazebo or/and RViz does not work
----------------------------------------------------------
Try:
* Convert the file to urdf if it is a xacro file via $ xacro <file_name>.xacro > <file_name>.xacro.urdf   # Note: .xacro.urdf illustrates that the original file was of type xacro
* Check the urdf file via $ check_urdf <file_name>.urdf.
* Check the urdf structure visually via $ urdf_to_graphiz <file_name>.urdf
* Check if the model and plugin path for Gazebo is set. If not add the lines bellow at the end of the .bashrc file or in code.

  export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-11/models
  export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-11/plugins
* Check if the model path is set in the package.xml file at the end before the closing </package> tag:

IMPORTANT: The following has to be added at the end of the package.xml of the <robot_name>_description package.
The above is very important, otherwise the robot doesn't get spawned in Gazebo.
...
<export>
  <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
  <!-- 
    NOTE: The following line is necessary so Gazebo is able to find the models. 
    Otherwise, the robot gets not displayed (you can observe this, because Gazebo loads slower). 
  -->
  <gazebo_ros gazebo_model_path="${prefix}/.." /> 
</export>


(2) Gazebo 11 does not run
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. First remove and purge all the libdart packages.
$ sudo apt remove --purge libdart*
If you have added dartsim/ppa ppa from this link, remove it from Software & Updates -> Other Software

2. Update
$ sudo apt update

3. Check if libdart-dev installs with:
$ sudo apt install libdart-dev

4. If it installs, then install all the packages required for Gazebo
$ sudo apt install libdart-all-dev

6. If there is an error related to unable to fetch some archives, try:
$ sudo apt update --fix-missing
$ sudo apt install libdart-all-dev

7. Install Gazebo again with:
$ curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh

8. Check if Gazebo is now working
